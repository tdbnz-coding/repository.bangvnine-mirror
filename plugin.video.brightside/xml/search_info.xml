[COLOR white]You will notice a new search function has been added to the home screen[/COLOR]
[COLOR khaki]
This function is intended as a back up for our normal links 
but can be used at anytime and may appear in other locations through the addon. 

It is under test at the moment to check the stability of streams it finds, 
However to best utilise it you should make your searches fairly general. 

If you search for one team in a game or one word it will normally find something. 

So Manchester United will not find Manchester Utd. 
United will find Manchester United, Newcastle United etc etc 

Best search method we've found so far is to use one word from 
either of the teams in a game or competitors in an event

So give it a try, let folk know what searches work best or worst etc.
