 v4.2.0 (23 March 2025)
This is a major quality-of-life update that brings more flexibility, stability, and compatibility.

Key Improvements:
Dual Mode Support:
The addon now fully supports both M3U and Xtream Codes (XC) API. You can choose which mode to use via the settings menu.

Structured Content Layout:
All categories are now separated cleanly into:

Live TV

VOD (Movies)

Series (TV Shows)
Each section shows only the correct groupings, filtering out unrelated content (e.g., VOD won't show up in Live TV).

Custom Credentials Support:
Don’t want to use the default server?
Enter your own server URL, username, and password in the settings, and the addon will automatically use those — completely bypassing the built-in media4u account.

M3U as Default Mode:
Since many servers have broken or limited Xtream API support, the addon now defaults to using the M3U playlist format, which works reliably with most IPTV providers.

Auto Caching for Speed:
To improve performance, the addon now caches M3U data for 1 hour. This drastically speeds up loading times and reduces repeated server requests.

The cache updates silently in the background.

Expired data is refreshed automatically when needed.

Improved Kodi Compatibility:
Replaced outdated functions (xbmc.translatePath) with modern ones (xbmcvfs.translatePath) to ensure the addon runs smoothly on Kodi 20+.
